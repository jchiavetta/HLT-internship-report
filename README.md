Code used in the research report for my internship with lum.ai.

Consists of four files:
* lum_files.py - processes the data from the company
* joint_probs.py - baseline commonness measure
* term_vectors.py - similarity measure based on vectors created with the Gensim package
* link_vectors.py. - similarity measure based on vectors created with just Wikipedia article links
